# FOC ESC HARDWARE
FOC(Field-Oriented Control) ESC is aimed at high-performance BLDC motor control.

The purpose of creating this repository is to share the hardware design to:
1. Get feedback from the community and improve it;
2. Attract people that are interested in this and have the capability to join the software development.

## Advantages of FOC

- Independent, simple control of torque and flux
- Provide smooth torque over the entire speed range
- Provide rated torque near zero speed
- Speed up the dynamic process of acceleration and deceleration

- Reduce mechanical vibration caused by torque fluctuations
- Reduce noise
- Improve efficiency
- Improve speed accuracy and responsiveness
