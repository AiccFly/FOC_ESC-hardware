# FOC ESC HARDWARE
Design for FPV community

## Introduction
FOC ESC is aimed for high performance motor control.

## Background
We intend to develop FOC ESC for the FPV community.
The design was orginally inspired by jaxxzer's sharing.

A manufacturer that does not want to disclose its name sponsored us, but we don't have that ability to develop the software.
And from that time, the original developer became time poor.

The purpose of setting this repository is to share the hardware design to:
1. listen to the community's views and improve it;
2. attract  people who are interested in this and have the capablity to join the software development work.

## Details
