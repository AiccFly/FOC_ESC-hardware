# Prototype G431 4IN1

Prototype G431 4IN1 is a 30.5x30.5mm 4IN1 ESC which can be easily amounted on drones. This design uses STM32G431KBU6 QFN32 chips. Reference design from STM's B-G431B-ESC1.

[STM32G431KUB6]() is a 32-pin chip. Due to the small number of pins on this chip, we cannot make it support CAN-FD on the basis of FOC pin map.
